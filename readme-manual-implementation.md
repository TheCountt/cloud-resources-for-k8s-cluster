# Step 0 - install client tools before bootstrapping the cluster

First, you will need some client tools installed and configurations made on your client workstation:

- **awscli** – is a unified tool to manage your AWS services
- **kubectl** – this command line utility will be your main control tool to manage your K8s cluster
- **cfssl** – an open source toolkit for everything TLS/SSL from Cloudflare
- **cfssljson** – a program, which takes the JSON output from the cfssl and writes certificates, keys, CSRs, and bundles to disk.
